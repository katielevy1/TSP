# Traveling Salesman Branch-and-Bound Solution
The program calculates the shortest route for the traveling salesman problem using a tree structure to explore branches of the tree, potential routes, but checking estimated upper and lower bounds on the optimal solution. The branch is discarded if its solution is worse than the best one so far.

The output, out.tsp, is the optimal route and the length of the tour.
